## API & Data Model Review

Evaluate for consistency and idiom:

### API Surface
- REST endpoint naming: consistent, predictable, resource-oriented?
- Response shapes: envelope conventions followed? Pagination consistent?
- Error formats: uniform across all endpoints?
- Versioning: applied consistently?
- Field naming: camelCase/snake_case consistent? Abbreviations standardized?

### Data Model
- Table/column naming conventions consistent?
- Foreign key relationships complete and documented?
- Migration strategy clear?
- Index strategy specified for query patterns?

### Design Rationale
- Is the "why" explained, not just the "what"?
- Would a new developer understand the design choices from the docs alone?
- Are there design decisions that should be ADRs but aren't?

### Idiom
- Does the API follow established conventions for its domain?
- Are there modern (2026) patterns that would improve the design?
- Is the API discoverable? Self-documenting?

Focus area: $ARGUMENTS

For every finding:
1. The inconsistency or improvement
2. The specific location (endpoint, table, section)
3. The proposed fix
